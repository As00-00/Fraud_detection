# Credit_Card Fraud Detection
This repository contains data analysis on credit card transaction to analyse and detect fraudulent transactions on Google Colab with the help of data analysis tools and classification machine learning models.
# Introduction
This is a very popular dataset openly available at Kaggle.

The major aim of this project is to help any organisation to be able to accurately and precisely detect the fraudulent transactions on the provided data itself and future transactions as well.
# Dataset
The dataset to be analysed is a highly imbalanced data,for obvious reasons(Since,fraud transactions are extremely less likely to occur)

Dataset-->https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The data consists of around quater a million observations i.e #transactions in the span of 2 days in September 2013 by European cardholders. Out  of which only 492 fraudulent transactions were recorded as per the data i.e only 0.17% (highly skewed data).

On record, there were plenty of original features of a particular transaction which included clients personal information, therefore for privacy purposes the data provided only had 31 features which were created by dimentionality reduction(PCA).
